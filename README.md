# HW3
## CSE 360 Individual homework 3

  The following files are from TP2 and serve as the foundation for my HW3 application. 
  With the database and foundationCode I was able to create the class FollowUpTests.java where my 5 Junit tests are located and the proper 
 Javadoc syntax is followed. 
  **FollowUpTests.java is the only class I made changes to from TP2.
